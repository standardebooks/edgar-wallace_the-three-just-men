				<p epub:type="title">The Golden Woman</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Barberton had been stricken down in the heart of London, under the very eyes of the policeman, it proved.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir, I’ve had him under observation for a quarter of an hour. I saw him walking along the Embankment, admiring the view, long before he stopped here.”</p>
			<p>“Did anybody go near him or speak to him?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Elver, looking up.</p>
			<p>“No, sir, he stood by himself. I’ll swear that nobody was within two yards of him. Of course, people have been passing to and fro, but I have been looking at him all the time, and I’ve not seen man or woman within yards of him, and my eyes were never off him.”</p>
			<p>A second policeman had appeared on the scene, and he was sent across to Scotland Yard in Manfred’s car, for the ambulance and the police reserves necessary to clear and keep in circulation the gathering crowd. These returned simultaneously, and the two friends watched the pitiable thing lifted into a stretcher, and waited until the white-bodied vehicle had disappeared with its sad load before they returned to their machine.</p>
			<p>Gonsalez took his place at the wheel; George got in by his side. No word was spoken until they were back at Curzon Street. Manfred went in alone, whilst his companion drove the machine to the garage. When he returned, he found Poiccart and George deep in discussion.</p>
			<p>“You were right, Raymond.” Leon Gonsalez stripped his thin coat and threw it on a chair. “The accuracy of your forecasts is almost depressing. I am waiting all the time for the inevitable mistake, and I am irritated when this doesn’t occur. You said the snake would reappear, and the snake has reappeared. Prophesy now for me, O seer!”</p>
			<p>Poiccart’s heavy face was gloomy; his dark eyes almost hidden under the frown that brought his bushy eyebrows lower.</p>
			<p>“One hasn’t to be a seer to know that our association with Barberton will send the snake wriggling towards Curzon Street,” he said. “Was it Gurther or Pfeiffer?”</p>
			<p>Manfred considered.</p>
			<p>“Pfeiffer, I think. He is the steadier of the two. Gurther has brainstorms; he is on the neurotic side. And that nine-thonged whip of yours, Leon, cannot have added to his mental stability. No, it was Pfeiffer, I’m sure.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose the whip unbalanced him a little,” said Leon. He thought over this aspect as though it were one worth consideration. “Gurther is a sort of Jekyll and Hyde, except that there is no virtue to him at all. It is difficult to believe, seeing him dropping languidly into his seat at the opera, that this exquisite young man in his private moments would not change his linen more often than once a month, and would shudder at the sound of a running bath-tap! That almost sounds as though he were a morphia fiend. I remember a case in ’99⁠ ⁠… but I am interrupting you?”</p>
			<p>“What precautions shall you take, Leon?” asked George Manfred.</p>
			<p>“Against the snake?” Leon shrugged his shoulders. “The old military precaution against Zeppelin raids; the precaution the farmer takes against a plague of wasps. You cannot kneel on the chest of the <i epub:type="z3998:taxonomy">vespa vulgaris</i> and extract his sting with an anaesthetic. You destroy his nest⁠—you bomb his hangar. Personally, I have never feared dissolution in any form, but I have a childish objection to being bitten by a snake.”</p>
			<p>Poiccart’s saturnine face creased for a moment in a smile. “You’ve no objection to stealing my theories,” he said dryly, and the other doubled up in silent laughter.</p>
			<p>Manfred was pacing the little room, his hands behind him, a thick Egyptian cigarette between his lips.</p>
			<p>“There’s a train leaves Paddington for Gloucester at ten forty-five,” he said. “Will you telegraph to Miss Goddard, Heavytree Farm, and ask her to meet the train with a cab? After that I shall want two men to patrol the vicinity of the farm day and night.”</p>
			<p>Poiccart pulled open a drawer of the desk, took out a small book and ran his finger down the index.</p>
			<p>“I can get this service in Gloucester,” he said. “Gordon, Williams, Thompson and Elfred⁠—they’re reliable people and have worked for us before.”</p>
			<p>Manfred nodded.</p>
			<p>“Send them the usual instructions by letter. I wonder who will be in charge of this Barberton case. If it’s Meadows, I can work with him. On the other hand, if it’s Arbuthnot, we shall have to get our information by subterranean methods.”</p>
			<p>“Call Elver,” suggested Leon, and George pulled the telephone towards him.</p>
			<p>It was some time before he could get into touch with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Elver, and then he learnt, to his relief, that the redoubtable Inspector Meadows had complete charge.</p>
			<p>“He’s coming up to see you,” said Elver. “As a matter of fact, the chief was here when I arrived at the Yard, and he particularly asked Meadows to consult with you. There’s going to be an awful kick at the Home Secretary’s office about this murder. We had practically assured the Home Office that there would be no repetition of the mysterious deaths and that the snake had gone dead for good.”</p>
			<p>Manfred asked a few questions and then hung up.</p>
			<p>“They are worried about the public⁠—you never know what masses will do in given circumstances. But you can gamble that the English mass does the same thing⁠—Governments hate intelligent crowds. This may cost the Home Secretary his job, poor soul! And he’s doing his best.”</p>
			<p>A strident shout in the street made him turn his head with a smile.</p>
			<p>“The late editions have got it⁠—naturally. It might have been committed on their doorstep.”</p>
			<p>“But why?” asked Poiccart. “What was Barberton’s offence?”</p>
			<p>“His first offence,” said Leon promptly, without waiting for Manfred to reply, “was to go in search of Miss Mirabelle Leicester. His second and greatest was to consult with us. He was a dead man when he left the house.”</p>
			<p>The faint sound of a bell ringing sent Poiccart down to the hall to admit an unobtrusive, middle-aged man, who might have been anything but what he was: one of the cleverest trackers of criminals that Scotland Yard had known in thirty years. A sandy-haired, thin-faced man, who wore pince-nez and looked like an actor, he had been a visitor to Curzon Street before, and now received a warm welcome. With little preliminary he came to the object of his call, and Manfred told him briefly what had happened, and the gist of his conversation with Barberton.</p>
			<p>“Miss Mirabelle Leicester is⁠—” began Manfred.</p>
			<p>“Employed by Oberzohn⁠—I know,” was the surprising reply. “She came up to London this morning and took a job as laboratory assistant. I had no idea that Oberzohn &amp; Smitts had a laboratory on the premises.”</p>
			<p>“They hadn’t until a couple of days ago,” interrupted Leon. “The laboratory was staged especially for her.”</p>
			<p>Meadows nodded, then turned to Manfred. “He didn’t give you any idea at all why he wanted to meet Miss Leicester?”</p>
			<p>George shook his head.</p>
			<p>“No, he was very mysterious indeed on that subject,” he said.</p>
			<p>“He arrived by the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Benguella</i>, eh?” said Meadows, making a note. “We ought to get something from the ship before they pay off their stewards. If a man isn’t communicative on board ship, he’ll never talk at all! And we may find something in his belongings. Would you like to come along, Manfred?”</p>
			<p>“I’ll come with pleasure,” said George gravely. “I may help you a little⁠—you will not object to my making my own interpretation of what we see?”</p>
			<p>Meadows smiled.</p>
			<p>“You will be allowed your private mystery,” he said.</p>
			<p>A taxi set them down at the Petworth Hotel in Norfolk Street, and they were immediately shown up to the room which the dead man had hired but had not as yet occupied. His trunk, still strapped and locked, stood on a small wooden trestle, his overcoat was hanging behind the door; in one corner of the room was a thick holdall, tightly strapped, and containing, as they subsequently discovered, a weather-stained mackintosh, two well-worn blankets and an air pillow, together with a collapsible canvas chair, also showing considerable signs of usage. This was the object of their preliminary search.</p>
			<p>The lock of the trunk yielded to the third key which the detective tried. Beyond changes of linen and two suits, one of which was practically new and bore the tab of a store in <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul de Loanda, there was very little to enlighten them. They found an envelope full of papers, and sorted them out one by one on the bed. Barberton was evidently a careful man: he had preserved his hotel bills, writing on their backs brief but pungent comments about the accommodation he had enjoyed or suffered. There was an hotel in Lobuo which was full of vermin; there was one at Mossamedes of which he had written:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Rats ate one boot. Landlord made no allowance. Took three towels and pillow-slip.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“One of the Four Just Men in embryo,” said Meadows dryly.</p>
			<p>Manfred smiled.</p>
			<p>On the back of one bill were closely written columns of figures: “126, 1315, 107, 1712, about 24,” <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Against a number of these figures the word “about” appeared, and Manfred observed that invariably this qualification marked one of the higher numbers. Against the 107 was a thick pencil mark.</p>
			<p>There were amongst the papers several other receipts. In <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul he had bought a “pistol automatic of precision” and ammunition for the same. The “pistol automatic of precision” was not in the trunk.</p>
			<p>“We found it in his pocket,” said Meadows briefly. “That fellow was expecting trouble, and was entitled to, if it is true that they tortured him at Mosamodes.”</p>
			<p>“Moss-<strong>am</strong>-o-dees,” Manfred corrected the mispronunciation. It almost amounted to a fad in him that to hear a place miscalled gave him a little pain.</p>
			<p>Meadows was reading a letter, turning the pages slowly.</p>
			<p>“This is from his sister: she lives at Brightlingsea, and there’s nothing in it except⁠ ⁠…” He read a portion of the letter aloud:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>“… thank you for the books. The children will appreciate them. It must have been like old times writing them⁠—but I can understand how it helped pass the time. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lee came over and asked if I had heard from you. He is wonderful.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The letter was in an educated hand.</p>
			<p>“He didn’t strike me as a man who wrote books,” said Meadows, and continued his search.</p>
			<p>Presently he unfolded a dilapidated map, evidently of Angola. It was rather on the small scale, so much so that it took in a portion of the Kalahari Desert in the south, and showed in the north the undulations of the rolling Congo.</p>
			<p>“No marks of any kind,” said Meadows, carrying the chart to the window to examine it more carefully. “And that, I think, is about all⁠—unless this is something.”</p>
			<p>“This” was wrapped in a piece of cloth, and was fastened to the bottom and the sides of the trunk by two improvised canvas straps. Meadows tried to pull it loose and whistled.</p>
			<p>“Gold,” he said. “Nothing else can weigh quite as heavily as this.”</p>
			<p>He lifted out the bundle eventually, unwrapped the covering, and gazed in amazement on the object that lay under his eyes. It was an African <i xml:lang="fr">bête</i>, a nude, squat idol, rudely shaped, the figure of a native woman.</p>
			<p>“Gold?” said Manfred incredulously, and tried to lift it with his finger and thumb. He took a firmer grip and examined the discovery closely.</p>
			<p>There was no doubt that it was gold, and fine gold. His thumbnail made a deep scratch in the base of the statuette. He could see the marks where the knife of the inartistic sculptor had sliced and carved.</p>
			<p>Meadows knew the coast fairly well: he had made many trips to Africa and had stopped off at various ports en route.</p>
			<p>“I’ve never seen anything exactly like it before,” he said, “and it isn’t recent workmanship either. When you see this”⁠—he pointed to a physical peculiarity of the figure⁠—“you can bet that you’ve got something that’s been made at least a couple of hundred years, and probably before then. The natives of West and Central Africa have not worn toe-rings, for example, since the days of the Caesars.”</p>
			<p>He weighed the idol in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Roughly ten pounds,” he said. “In other words, eight hundred pounds’ worth of gold.”</p>
			<p>He was examining the cloth in which the idol had been wrapped, and uttered an exclamation.</p>
			<p>“Look at this,” he said.</p>
			<p>Written on one corner, in indelible pencil, were the words:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Second shelf up left Gods lobby sixth.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Suddenly Manfred remembered.</p>
			<p>“Would you have this figure put on the scales right away?” he said. “I’m curious to know the exact weight.”</p>
			<p>“Why?” asked Meadows in surprise, as he rang the bell.</p>
			<p>The proprietor himself, who was aware that a police search was in progress, answered the call, and, at the detective’s request, hurried down to the kitchen and returned in a few minutes with a pair of scales, which he placed on the table. He was obviously curious to know the purpose for which they were intended, but Inspector Meadows did not enlighten him, standing pointedly by the door until the gentleman had gone.</p>
			<p>The figure was taken from under the cloth where it had been hidden whilst the scales were being placed, and put in one shallow pan on the machine.</p>
			<p>“Ten pounds seven ounces,” nodded Manfred triumphantly. “I thought that was the one!”</p>
			<p>“One what?” asked the puzzled Meadows.</p>
			<p>“Look at this list.”</p>
			<p>Manfred found the hotel bill with the rows of figures and pointed to the one which had a black cross against it.</p>
			<p>“107,” he said. “That is our little fellow, and the explanation is fairly plain. Barberton found some treasure-house filled with these statues. He took away the lightest. Look at the figures! He weighed them with a spring balance, one of those which register up to 21 <abbr class="eoc">lbs.</abbr> Above that he had to guess⁠—he puts ‘about 24,’ ‘about 22.’ ”</p>
			<p>Meadows looked at his companion blankly, but Manfred was not deceived. That clever brain of the detective was working.</p>
			<p>“Not for robbery⁠—the trunk is untouched. They did not even burn his feet to find the idol or the treasure-house: they must have known nothing of that. It was easy to rob him⁠—or, if they knew of his gold idol, they considered it too small loot to bother with.”</p>
			<p>He looked slowly round the apartment. On the mantelshelf was a slip of brown paper like a pipe-spill. He picked it up, looked at both sides, and, finding the paper blank, put it back where he had found it. Manfred took it down and absently drew the strip between his sensitive fingertips.</p>
			<p>“The thing to do,” said Meadows, taking one final look round, “is to find Miss Leicester.”</p>
			<p>Manfred nodded.</p>
			<p>“That is one of the things,” he said slowly. “The other, of course, is to find Johnny.”</p>
			<p>“Johnny?” Meadows frowned suspiciously. “Who is Johnny?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Johnny is my private mystery.” George Manfred was smiling. “You promised me that I might have one!”</p>
